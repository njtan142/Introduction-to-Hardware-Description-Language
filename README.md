This is my journal for taking this course which is intended for personal use but I don't mind publishing it so why not give it a try. I don't intent to make it friendly for other's but I'll make sure to keep things organized, it's the least I could do. 

Since this is a public git repository, anyone is free to do anything to this. I wont enforce any licensing or agreement, just don't attribute any altered works to me unless it has been published to this original repository.
