I need to install the quartus prime lite first with the max10 support (download with the provided installer). Then download the modelsim. Afterwards download the DESim tool which is open source.

Intel seems to provide an fpga course which should be worthwile to take: https://fpgacademy.org/courses.html

- The course will use DE-series boards, so maybe that's why we were also required to install desim. Since the hardwares are hard or expensive to acquire.
