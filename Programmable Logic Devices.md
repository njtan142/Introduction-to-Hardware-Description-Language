- An IC that contains large numbers of gates, flip-flops, etc. that can be configured by the user to perform different function is called a Programmable Logic Device (PLD) 
- The purpose of a PLD device is to permit elaborate digital logic designs to be implemented by the user in a single device
- Can be erased electrically and reprogrammed with a new design, making them very well suited for academic and prototyping 


Problems by using standard ICs
- Many components on PCB
- As the number of components, rises, nodes interconnection complexity grows exponentially
- Growth in interconnection will cause an increase in interference, PCB size, PCB design cost, and manufacturing time (takes a great deal of time and cost in inserting, soldering, and testing)
- Does not allow the users to expand or build on their existing functionalities.
- Require keeping a significant inventory of ICs

Advantages of using PLDS
- less board space
- faster
- lower power requirements (i.e., smaller power supplies)
- less costly assembly processes
- higher reliability (fewer ICs and circuit connections means easier troubleshooting)
- and availability of inexpensive software used to develop, code and test the required design
